`Babylon 5: We've Lost Her` is a roaming merchant text game based on the universe of Babylon 5 invented by JMS.
The game is being written in Haskell and will be released under a freeware open-source license.

Gameplay will vaguely resemble games like `Sea Legends`, trade parts of `Pirates of the Caribbean`, `Elite`, `X` series, `Space Rangers` and such, while remaining in console text form. Concrete documentation, including concept document and design document, does not exist and most likely will never exist. 

My design goal is to provide deep, touching experience of being in the Babylon 5 universe, combined with solving various strategical, optimization and role-playing tasks in order to fulfill the main quest's aims. The game takes place between the years of 2257 and 2261, between the launch of the last of the Babylon stations and the Earth Alliance Civil War. Player's overall goal throughout the game process is to provide victory to the rebelling Earth Alliance forces.

This game is dedicated to Commander Susan Ivanova, who had suffered mortal injuries during the Battle of Sector 300.

I deeply appreciate Joseph Michael Straczynski's work and creative genius and hold no claims upon the universe he invented or any of its parts.
